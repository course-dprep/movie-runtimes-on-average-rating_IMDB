__Introduction__
Hi there! Welcome to our GitHub repository. 
Movies have all different run times. Some are really long, some are "short". We wanted to know if this actually influences peoples opinion about the movies. 


__Preliminary research question__
  What is the relationship between the runtime and the average user rating for movies?
