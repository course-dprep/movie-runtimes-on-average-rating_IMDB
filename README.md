*What is the relationship between the runtime and the average user rating for movies?*

## __Motivation__
Hi there! Welcome to our GitHub repository. 
Movies have all different run times. Some are really long, some are "short". We want to know if this actually influences peoples opinion about the movies. With doing this, we want to contribute to marketing insights into the effects of run times on people's average ratings of movies. The results of this project can give useful insights to movie producers into how the run times of their movies affect their ratings, and hence, the profitability of their movies. 

## __Method and results__
To find this out, we are using imdb.com data to inspect the run time of movies and their average ratings.
